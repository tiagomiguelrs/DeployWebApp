Type the following into the Procfile:

web: gunicorn main:app

This will tell our hosting provider to create a web worker that is able to receive HTTP requests.
The Procfile also says to use gunicorn to serve your web app.
And finally it specifies the Flask app object is the main.py file.
That way the hosting provider knows about the entry point for the app and what our app is called.

NOTE: If your app is not inside a file called main.py then you should change main to your file name.
